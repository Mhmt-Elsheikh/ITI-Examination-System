## 📌 Project Overview
The **ITI Examination System** is a comprehensive, end-to-end educational ecosystem designed to manage the entire academic lifecycle at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).

This project goes beyond a simple web application; it is a full-scale **Data Engineering and Business Intelligence solution**. It starts from transactional data entry (OLTP), moves through complex data modeling and warehousing (OLAP), and culminates in advanced analytics and reporting.

The system serves multiple stakeholders: **Admins, Training Managers, Instructors, and Students**, providing a seamless interface for exam creation, grading, and performance tracking.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Data Modeling

This project demonstrates a complete data journey:

### 1. Database Design (OLTP)
* Designed a highly normalized **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to handle transactional operations efficiently.
* Managed relationships between Entities: *Students, Courses, Instructors, Departments, Branches, and Intakes*.
* Implemented constraints, triggers, and stored procedures to ensure data integrity during exam taking and grading.

### 2. Data Warehousing (OLAP) - The Galaxy Schema
To enable high-performance analytics, we transformed our transactional data into a Data Warehouse using a **Galaxy Schema (Fact Constellation)** architecture. This complex model includes:
* **Multiple Fact Tables:**
    * `Fact_Exam`: Tracking exam metadata and scheduling.
    * `Fact_StudentAnswer`: Granular analysis of every answer by every student.
    * `Fact_StudentResult`: Aggregated scores and pass/fail status.
    * `Fact_Freelance`: Monitoring student freelance jobs and revenue (Unique Feature).
    * `Fact_Hiring`: Tracking post-graduation employment.
* **Shared Dimensions (Conformed Dimensions):**
    * `Dim_Student`, `Dim_Course`, `Dim_Date`, `Dim_Instructor`, `Dim_Branch`.

## 📊 Business Intelligence & Analytics (Power BI & SSRS)

We utilized **Microsoft Power BI** and **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** to derive actionable insights from the Data Warehouse.

### 1. Advanced Power BI Dashboards (20+ Reports)
We created over **20 interactive dashboards** covering:
* **Academic Performance:** Analysis of student grades, pass rates, and failure rates per track/branch.
* **Exam Quality:** Analyzing question difficulty and discrimination indices.
* **Freelance ROI:** Tracking the revenue generated by students during their study (referencing `Fact_StudentFreelance`).
* **Hiring Trends:** Post-graduation employment rates by department.

**Key DAX Measures Implemented:**
* `Student Pass Rate %`
* `Average Freelance Cost by Job Category`
* `Year-over-Year (YoY) Intake Growth`
* `Dynamic Top N Students`

### 2. SSRS Operational Reports
Generated pixel-perfect reports for official documentation:
* **Student Transcripts:** Detailed grade reports for each student.
* **Certificate Generation:** Automated graduation certificates.
* **Course Feedback Reports:** Aggregated student feedback per instructor.
